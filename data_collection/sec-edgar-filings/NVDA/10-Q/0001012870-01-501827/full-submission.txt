              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (Unaudited)

(1) Basis of presentation

     The accompanying condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements were
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for
a fair presentation have been included. The results for the interim periods
presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future
period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2001.

Reclassifications

     Certain prior year balances were reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation.

(2) Recent Pronouncements

     On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), voted
unanimously to approve Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 141 (FAS
141), "Business Combinations" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
142 (FAS 142), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". FAS 141 will require the
purchase method of accounting on all transactions initiated after June 30, 2001
and the pooling of interests method will no longer be allowed. FAS 142 will
require that goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets that have an
indeterminable life, be recognized as assets but not amortized. These assets
will be assessed for impairment on an annual basis. Identifiable intangible
assets that have a determinable life will continue to be segregated from
goodwill and amortized over their useful lives. These assets will be assessed
for impairment pursuant to guidance in FAS 121. Companies will be required to
maintain documentation of their impairment testing activities and include
significant disclosure in filings in the event of an impairment charge. Goodwill
and other intangible assets arising from acquisitions completed before July 1,
2001 (previously recognized goodwill and intangible assets) will be accounted
for in accordance with the provisions of FAS 142 beginning January 28, 2002. The
Company has not determined the impact of these pronouncements on its financial
position and results of operations. Any acquisitions consummated between July 1,
2001 and January 27, 2002 will be accounted for in accordance with the
provisions of FAS 141 and 142.

(3) Business Combination

     During the first half of fiscal year 2002, the Company completed the
purchase of certain assets from various businesses, including 3dfx Interactive,
Inc. ("3dfx") and other acquisitions, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $78.7 million. These acquisitions have been accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting. Excluding the 3dfx transaction, the aggregate
purchase price for all other acquisitions are immaterial to the financials of
the Company.

     On April 18, 2001, the Company completed the purchase of certain assets of
3dfx, including patents and patent applications. Under the terms of the Asset
Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70 million,
less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated
December 15, 2000, between the Company and 3dfx. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement, following the closing, the Company is to pay 3dfx additional
consideration in the form of stock equal to one million shares of the Company's
common stock, subject to 3dfx satisfying certain conditions. If the debts and
liabilities of 3dfx cannot be satisfied, under some circumstances, 3dfx could
receive a post-

closing advance from the Company of up to $25.0 million and this advance would
reduce the number of shares of the Company's common stock receivable by 3dfx by
up to 500,000 shares. Consequently, due to the possibility of contingent
consideration, the components of the estimated purchase price could differ from
that presented below. In addition, following the closing, the Company and 3dfx
filed a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice the patent litigation between the
parties. The litigation was dismissed on April 26, 2001, pursuant to a judicial
order.

     As of July 29, 2001, the 3dfx asset purchase price of $70.0 million and
direct transaction costs of $4.1 million related to the closing were allocated
based on fair values as follows:

                                                                 Straight-Line

                                                    3dfx            Period

                                                 =======

     The final allocation will depend upon the composition of 3dfx assets
acquired and the Company's evaluation of the fair value of the net assets.
Consequently, the actual allocation of the purchase price could differ from that
presented above.

Pro Forma Results of Operations

     The following summary, prepared on a pro forma basis, presents the results
of operations as if 3dfx assets were purchased as of the beginning of the
periods presented. Pro forma net income for the three and six months ending July
29, 2001 includes the impact of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets
of $4.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively. Excluded are acquisition related
charges of $764,000 and $10.3 million for the three and six months ending July
29, 2001, and assumed tax benefits of $229,000 and $2.0 million for the same
periods. For the three and six months ending July 30, 2000, pro forma net income
includes the same amount of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets. Also
included are assumed salary related expenses of $4.2 million and $8.3 million
and tax benefits of $2.6 million and $5.3 million for the three and six months
ending July 30, 2000.

(4) Net Income Per Share

     Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the as-if-converted
method for convertible debt and the treasury stock method for options. The
common-equivalent shares which were antidilutive for the three and six months
ended July 29, 2001 were 3,235,897 and 3,431,896, respectively.

(8) Microsoft Agreement

     On March 5, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Microsoft in
which the Company agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license
certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox video game
console under development by Microsoft. In April 2000, Microsoft paid us $200.0
million as an advance against graphics chip purchases. Microsoft may terminate
the agreement at any time. If termination occurs prior to offset in full of the
advance payments, the Company would be required to return to Microsoft up to
$100.0 million of the prepayment and to convert the remainder into our preferred
stock at a 30% premium to the 30-day average trading price of our common stock
preceding Microsoft's termination of the agreement. In addition, in the event
that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or
greater than thirty percent (30%) of the outstanding shares of our common stock,
Microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The
graphics chip contemplated by the agreement is highly complex, and the
development and release of the Microsoft Xbox video game console and its
commercial success are dependent upon a number of parties, such as hardware and
software developers, and a number of factors, many of which are outside of our
control.

     On February 14, 2001, the Company announced that the Xbox GPU and Xbox
media communications processor were released to Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company for prototype fabrication. In July 2001, the Company began
to ship production units to Microsoft. The $200.0 million advance was drawn down
in relation to the shipments made during the quarter.

(9) Litigation

     On February 22, 2000, Graphiques Matrox, Inc. and Systemes Electroniques
Matrox Ltd. (collectively "Matrox") filed suit against the Company in the
Superior Court, Judicial District of Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada. The
suit alleged that the Company improperly solicited and recruited Matrox
employees and encouraged Matrox employees to breach their Matrox confidentiality
and/or non-competition agreements. The suit by Matrox sought, among other
things, certain injunctive relief. The trial of this matter occurred during
April 2001. On July 12, 2001, the court issued its ruling in favor of the
Company and dismissed all of Matrox's claims. Matrox has not appealed this
ruling and the time for appeal passed on August 13, 2001.

     Sunonwealth Electric Machine Industry Co., Ltd. filed a complaint against
the Company in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, for infringement of US Patent Nos. 6,109,892 and 6,114,785. The
underlying case is Sunonwealth v. Adda Corporation, et al, filed in the United
States District Court for the Central District on October 19, 2000. Both cases
have been consolidated. The patents are for a positioning device for a sensor
element of a miniature fan. The Company purchased these fans from Adda. Adda has
agreed to defend the Company and to pay any judgment rendered against the
Company as well as the cost of any settlement to the extent that the Company's
liability in such settlement arises from patent infringement resulting from its
purchase of products from Adda.

     On August 3, 2001 the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued its
decision in a patent infringement action originally brought in 1998 by S3
Incorporated (now SONICblue Incorporated). The decision vacated the district's
court summary judgment in favor of the Company and dismissal of the action
relative to certain disputed claims and remanded the matter back to the district
court. Under a previous settlement agreement with S3, the Company agreed to pay
up to $2.0 million if S3's appeal of the district court judgment was decided in
favor of S3. The Company made a payment of $1.9 million in August 2001 to fully
satisfy its obligation under the settlement.

(10) Subsequent Event

     In August 2001, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one
stock split of the Company's common stock for stockholders of record on August
28, 2001, to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The transfer
agent is expected to distribute the additional shares resulting from the stock
dividend on September 11, 2001.

Overview

     We design, develop and market graphics processors and related software for
personal computers and digital entertainment platforms. We provide a
"top-to-bottom" family of award-winning performance 3D graphics processors and
GPUs that set the standard for performance, quality and features for a broad
range of desktop PCs, from professional workstations to low-cost PCs, and mobile
PCs, from performance laptops to thin-and-light notebooks. Our 3D graphics
processors are used for a wide variety of applications, including games, digital
image editing, business productivity, the Internet and industrial design. Our
graphics processors were the first to incorporate a 128-bit multi-texturing
graphics architecture designed to deliver to users of our products a highly
immersive, interactive 3D experience with compelling visual quality, realistic
imagery and motion, stunning effects and complex object and scene interaction at
real-time frame rates. The NVIDIA TNT2, TNT2 M64 and Vanta graphics processors
deliver high performance 3D and 2D graphics at affordable prices, making them
the graphics hardware of choice for a wide range of applications for both
consumer and commercial use. Our graphics processors are designed to be
architecturally compatible backward and forward between generations, giving our
original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers and end users a low cost of
ownership. We are recognized for developing the world's first GPU, the GeForce
256, which incorporates independent hardware transform and lighting processing
units along with a complete rendering pipeline into a single-chip architecture.
Our GPUs, the GeForce3, the GeForce2 Ultra, the GeForce2 GTS, the GeForce2 MX,
the GeForce2 Go, the NVIDIA Quadro2 Pro and the Quadro2 MXR, process hundreds of
billions of operations per second and increase the PC's ability to render
high-definition 3D scenes in real-time. Our GPU families provide superior
processing and rendering power at competitive prices and are architected to
deliver the maximum performance from industry standards such as Microsoft's
Direct3D Application Programming Interface (API) and Silicon Graphics, Inc.'s
(SGI's) OpenGL API on Windows operating systems and Linux platforms.

     We recognize revenue from product sales to customers when a contract is in
place, the price is determined, shipment is made and collectability is
reasonably assured. Our policy on sales to distributors and stocking
representatives is to defer recognition of sales and related cost of sales until
the distributors and representatives resell the product. Royalty revenue is
recognized upon shipment of product by the licensee to its customers. We believe
that the software sold with our products is incidental to the product as a
whole.

     Currently, all of our product sales and our arrangements with third-party
manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars. We have not
engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the
future. Since we have no other product line, our business would suffer if for
any reason our graphics processors do not achieve widespread acceptance in the
PC market.

     A majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers and
sales are highly concentrated. We sell graphics processors to add-in board and
motherboard manufacturersand contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs. These
manufacturers incorporate our processors into the boards they sell to PC OEMs,
retail outlets and systems integrators. The average selling prices for our
products, as well as our customers' products, vary by distribution channel. Our
three largest customers accounted for approximately 43% of revenues for the
second quarter of fiscal 2002 and 48% of revenues for the first half of fiscal
2002. Sales to Edom Technology Co., Ltd. accounted for 21%, sales to Celestica
accounted for 11%, and sales to Atlantic Semiconductor accounted for 11% of our
total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2002. For the first half of
fiscal 2002, sales to Edom accounted for 26%, sales to Celestica accounted for
10%, and sales to Atlantic Semiconductor account for 12% of our total revenue.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2001, sales to Edom accounted for 21% and sales
to Celestica accounted for 11% of our total revenue. For the first half of
fiscal 2001, sales to Edom accounted for 22% and sales to Celestica accounted
for 10% of our total revenue. The number of potential customers for our products
is limited, and we expect sales to be concentrated to a few major customers for
the foreseeable future.

     As markets for our 3D graphics processors develop and competition
increases, we anticipate that product life cycles in the high end will remain
short and average selling prices will continue to decline. In

                                       11

<PAGE>

particular, average selling prices and gross margins are expected to decline as
each product matures. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and major
OEM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice
per year for the high end, typically based on spring and fall design cycles. In
order to maintain average selling prices and gross margins, our existing and new
products must achieve competitive performance levels to be designed into new
system configurations and must be produced at low costs, in sufficient volumes
and on a timely basis, especially with respect to our new products.

     We currently utilize Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC,
to produce semiconductor wafers, and utilize independent contractors to perform
assembly, test and packaging. We depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a
portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce
products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields, and to
deliver those products to us on a timely basis. These manufacturers may not
always be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements.
Yields or product performance could suffer due to difficulties associated with
adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology
and design rules of a new manufacturer. The level of finished goods inventory we
maintain may fluctuate and therefore a manufacturing disruption experienced by
these manufacturers would impact the production of our products, which could
harm our business. In addition, as the complexity of our products and the
accompanying manufacturing process increases, there is an increasing risk that
we will experience problems with the performance of new products and that there
will be yield problems or other delays in the development or introduction of
these products.

     Substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders
rather than long-term agreements. As a result, we may commit resources to the
production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from
customers. Any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant
resources could harm our business. In addition, cancellation or deferral of
product orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could
adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations.
We may build memory and component inventories during periods of anticipated
growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major OEMs.
We could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take
corresponding write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product
demand. A reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and
financial results. Product returns or delays or difficulties in collecting
accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income, which
could harm our business.

     On April 18, 2001, we completed the purchase of certain assets of 3dfx
Interactive, Inc., including patents and patent applications. Under the terms of
the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was
$70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit
Agreement dated December 15, 2000, between us and 3dfx. Pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement, following the closing, we are to pay 3dfx additional
consideration in the form of stock equal to one million shares of NVIDIA common
stock, subject to 3dfx satisfying certain conditions. In addition, following the
closing, we and 3dfx filed a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice the patent
litigation between us. The litigation was dismissed on April 26, 2001, pursuant
to a judicial order. The transaction is accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. See Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements.

</TABLE>

Three months and six months ended July 29, 2001, and July 30, 2000.

   Revenue

     Revenue increased 53% to $260.3 million in the second quarter ended July
29, 2001 from $170.4 million in the second quarter ended July 30, 2000. Revenue
of $501.2 million for the first half of fiscal 2002 grew 57% over the first half
of fiscal 2001. The growth was primarily the result of increased sales of our
graphics processors and the strong demand for new products at higher unit
average selling prices. Revenue from sales outside of the United States
accounted for 89% of total revenue for the second quarter ended July 29, 2001
and 91% of total revenue for the first half of fiscal 2002. Revenue from sales
outside of the U.S. represented 86% of total revenue in the second quarter ended
July 30, 2000 and 88% in the first half of fiscal 2001. This increase in revenue
from sales outside of the United States is primarily attributable to (i)
expanded use of CEMs, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers located outside
of the United States, and (ii) increased demand for our products in the Asia
Pacific region. Revenue by geographical region is allocated to individual
countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed. The
portion of revenue derived from foreign CEMs and add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers that are attributable to end customers in the United States is not
separately disclosed. Although we achieved substantial growth in product revenue
for the first half of 2002 from the same period in fiscal 2001, we do not expect
to sustain this rate of growth in future periods. In addition, we expect that
the average selling prices of our products will decline over the lives of the
products. The declines in average selling prices of 3D graphics processors
generally may also accelerate as the market develops and competition increases.

   Gross Profit

     Gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of
revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of semiconductors
purchased from contract manufacturers (including assembly, test and packaging),
manufacturing support costs (labor and overhead associated with such purchases),
inventory provisions and shipping costs. Our gross profit margin can vary in any
period depending on the mix of types of graphics processors sold. Gross profit
increased 63% from the second quarter of fiscal 2001 to the same period of
fiscal 2002, and 64% from the first half of fiscal 2001 to the same period of
fiscal 2002, primarily due to significant increases in unit shipments and the
favorable impact of the higher margin GeForce graphics processors, partially
offset by declining profit margins in our older product families. Although we
achieved substantial growth in gross profit and margin from the first half of
fiscal 2001 to the same period of fiscal 2002, we do not expect to sustain these
rates of growth in future periods.

   Operating Expenses

     Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist of
salaries and benefits, cost of development tools and software, costs of
prototypes of new products and consultant costs. Research and development
expenses increased by 68% from the second quarter of fiscal 2001 to the same
period of fiscal 2002, and 71% from the first half of fiscal 2001 to the first
half of fiscal 2002, primarily due to new employees from 3dfx, a move to new
headquarters, the addition of personnel and related engineering costs to support
our next generation's products, such as depreciation charges incurred on capital
expenditures and

                                       13

<PAGE>

software license and maintenance fees. We anticipate that we will continue to
devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these
expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to
increased complexity and the number of products under development. Research and
development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we
make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these
investments may be independent of our level of revenues.

     Sales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative
expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and bonuses, promotional
tradeshow and advertising expenses, travel and entertainment expenses and legal
and accounting expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by
36% from the second quarter of fiscal 2001 to the same period of fiscal 2002,
and 44% from the first half of fiscal 2001 to the first half of fiscal 2002,
primarily due to costs associated with additional personnel and commissions and
bonuses on sales of the GeForce families of graphic processors. We expect sales
and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we
continue to expand our operations and our sales. General and administrative
expenses are also likely to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to
expand our operations. However, we do not expect significant changes in these
expenses as a percentage of revenue in future periods.

     Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. Amortization of
goodwill and purchased intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and
intangible assets from the asset purchase of 3dfx. The initial allocation of the
purchase price was to (i) workforce in place, amortized over two years, (ii)
patents and trademarks, amortized over five years and (iii) goodwill, amortized
over five years. The final allocation will depend upon the additional
consideration given to 3dfx, subject to 3dfx satisfying certain conditions.
Consequently, the actual allocation of the purchase price could differ from that
presented in Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Acquisition related charges. Acquisition related charges are attributable
to expenses related to the acquisition of 3dfx. These charges primarily
consisted of bonuses for employees.

     Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

     Interest expense increased for the second quarter and the first half of
fiscal 2002 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2001 due to the issuance of
$300.0 million of convertible debt in October 2000. Interest income increased
63% during the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2002 from the same
periods in fiscal 2001 due to higher average cash balances as a result of the
$200.0 million advance received from Microsoft in connection with our agreement
with Microsoft and the receipt of $387.4 million from our combined convertible
debt and common stock offerings which closed in October 2000.

     Income Taxes

     Income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was 30% for the first half
of fiscal 2002 and 32% for the same period in fiscal 2001. Foreign income which
is taxed at rates lower than the United States statutory rates contributed to
the lower tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2002.

     Stock-Based Compensation

     With respect to stock options granted to employees, we recorded deferred
compensation of $4.3 million in 1997 and $361,000 in the one month ended January
31, 1998. These amounts are being amortized over the vesting period of the
individual options, generally four years. We amortized approximately $6,000 in
the first half of fiscal 2002 and $85,000 in the first half of fiscal 2001.
Deferred compensation was fully amortized during the first half of fiscal 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     As of July 29, 2001, we had $681.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, an
increase of $6.8 million from the end of fiscal 2001. We historically have held
our cash balances in cash equivalents such as money

                                       14

<PAGE>

market funds or as cash. We place the money market funds with high-quality
financial institutions and limit the amount of exposure with any one financial
institution. We had $159.2 million of non-cancelable manufacturing commitments
outstanding at July 29, 2001.

     Operating activities generated cash of $93.8 million during the first half
of fiscal 2002 and $34.7 million during the first half of fiscal 2001. The
increase from the first half of fiscal 2001 to the same period in fiscal 2002
was due to a substantial increase in net income and changes in operating assets
and liabilities. Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated. At July 29,
2001, the three largest customers accounted for approximately 37% of accounts
receivable. Although we have not experienced any significant bad debt write-offs
to date, we may be required to write off bad debt in the future, which could
harm our business.

     To date, our investing activities have consisted primarily of acquisitions
of businesses and purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements
for our new facility under construction. We incurred acquisition costs of $64.1
million during the first half of fiscal 2002, primarily due to the closing of
3dfx asset purchase. There were no acquisitions during the same period a year
ago. Our capital expenditures increased from $15.1 million in the first half of
fiscal 2001 to $55.6 million in the first half of fiscal 2002. The increase was
primarily attributable to the construction of our new facility as well as for
purchases of computer and emulation equipment to support increased research and
development activities. We expect capital expenditures to increase as we further
expand research and development initiatives and as our employee base grows. The
timing and amount of future capital expenditures will depend primarily on our
future growth. We expect to spend approximately $70.0 million to $80.0 million
for capital expenditures in fiscal 2002, primarily for software licenses,
emulation equipment, purchase of computer and engineering workstations, future
phases of enterprise resource planning system implementation and tenant and
leasehold improvements in our new headquarters facility.

     In April 2000, we entered into leases for our new headquarters complex in
Santa Clara, California. Our new complex will comprise four buildings,
representing approximately 500,000 total square feet. The first phase of two
buildings consisting of approximately 250,000 square feet was completed in June
2001, and the second phase of one building consisting of approximately 125,000
square feet was completed in July 2001. We expect the last phase consisting of
approximately 125,000 square feet to be completed in March 2002. As of August
31, 2001, restricted cash related to the construction decreased to $7.1 million
from $28.1 million at July 29, 2001. The leases expire in 2012 and include two
seven-year renewals at our option. The future minimum lease payments under these
operating leases total approximately $224.8 million over the terms of the
leases. We currently are in the process of locating a subtenant for our former
office space and a subtenant for one of the buildings that will comprise part of
our new office complex. We may be unable to secure subtenants for both spaces
due to the recent decrease in demand for commercial rental space in Santa Clara.
See "Certain Business Risks - We recently moved into new headquarters. If we are
unable to sublease our excess space, we will have increased operating expenses
which may have a negative impact on our net income."

     Financing activities provided cash of $36.2 million in the first half of
fiscal 2002 compared to $208.0 million in the same period of fiscal 2001. On
March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to
develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft
and its licensees for use in a product under development by Microsoft. In April
2000, Microsoft paid us $200.0 million as an advance against graphics chip
purchases. Microsoft may terminate the agreement at any time. If termination
occurs prior to offset in full of the advance payments, we would be required to
return to Microsoft up to $100.0 million of the prepayment and to convert the
remainder into shares of our preferred stock a 30% premium to the 30-day average
trading price of our common stock preceding Microsoft's termination of the
agreement. In July 2001, we began to ship production units to Microsoft, and the
$200.0 million advance was drawn down in relation to the shipments made during
the quarter.

     We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from
operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for
at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not
need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame.
Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may
be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional
capital for other purposes not presently contemplated.

                                       15

If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail
capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which
could harm our business.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

     The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal
while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from the investments
without significantly increasing risk. To minimize potential loss arising from
adverse changes in interest rates, we maintain a portfolio of cash and cash
equivalents primarily in highly rated domestic money market funds. In general,
money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on
such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our convertible
subordinated notes are at a fixed interest rate of 4 3/4% and are not subject to
interest rate fluctuations.

Exchange Rate Risk

     We consider our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be
minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers
provide for pricing and payment in U.S. dollars, and therefore are not subject
to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not engaged in any currency
hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in
currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future.

Certain Business Risks

     In addition to the risks discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," our business is subject to
the risks set forth below.

     Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate.

     Many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict, and
our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular
period. It is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and
profits or losses. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our
operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts and
investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline,
perhaps substantially. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of
operations will be affected by a variety of factors that could adversely affect
our revenue, gross profit and results of operations.

     Factors that have affected our results of operations in the past, and could
affect our results of operations in the future, include the following:

     .    demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers'
          products;

     .    the successful development and volume production of next-generation
          products;

     .    new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors;

     .    our ability to introduce new products in accordance with OEM design
          requirements and design cycles;

     .    changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in
          the introduction of our customers' products;

     .    fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or
          manufacturing yields;

     .    declines in spending by corporations and consumers related to
          perceptions regarding an economic downturn in the U.S. and
          international regions;

                                       16

<PAGE>

     .    competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling
          prices;

     .    rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to
          quality issues;

     .    the rescheduling of shipments or cancellation of customer orders;

     .    the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic
          relationship;

     .    seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC market;

     .    substantial disruption in our suppliers' operations, either as a
          result of a natural disaster, equipment failure or other cause;

     .    supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components
          incorporated into our customers' products, including memory devices;

     .    our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;

     .    legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property;

     .    bad debt write-offs;

     .    costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective
          products;

     .    unexpected inventory write-downs; and

     .    introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster
          generations of processors and controllers.

     Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from
achieving our expected future revenue or net income.

     Because most operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, we
may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate
for any unexpected sales shortfall. We may be required to reduce prices in
response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities. If new
competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive
factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in
research and development or sales and marketing efforts, our business could
suffer. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results
of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
In addition, the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results
to be expected for a full fiscal year.

     Our 3D graphics solution may not continue to be accepted by the PC market.

     Our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our 3D
graphics processors for high performance 3D graphics in PC applications. The
market for 3D graphics processors has been characterized by unpredictable and
sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often caused by the
publication of competitive industry benchmark results, changes in dynamic random
memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of add-in
boards, as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology
and product introductions. Only a small number of products have achieved broad
market acceptance and such market acceptance, if achieved, is difficult to
sustain due to intense competition. Since we have no other product lines, our
business would suffer if for any reason our current or future 3D graphics
processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the PC market. If
we are unable to complete the timely development of or successfully and
cost-effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of
the PC market, our business would be harmed.

     Our integrated graphics product may not be accepted by the PC market.

     We expect that integrated graphics chipset products will become an
increasing part of the lower cost segment of the PC graphics market. We recently
announced an integrated chipset product and are currently developing future
products. If these products are not competitive in this segment and the
integrated chipset

                                       17

<PAGE>

segment continues to account for an increasing percentage of the units sold in
the PC market, our business may suffer.

     We need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order
to succeed.

     Our business will depend to a significant extent on our ability to
successfully develop new products for the 3D graphics market. Our add-in board
and motherboard manufacturers and major OEM customers typically introduce new
system configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring and
fall design cycles. Accordingly, our existing products must have competitive
performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such
performance characteristics in order to be included in new system
configurations. This requires that we do the following:

     .  anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand;

     .  incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the
        exacting design requirements of PC OEMs, or add-in board and motherboard
        manufacturers and CEMs;

     .  price our products competitively; and

     .  introduce the products to the market within the limited window for PC
        OEMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers.

     As a result, we believe that significant expenditures for research and
development will continue to be required in the future. The success of new
product introductions will depend on several factors, including the following:

     .  proper new product definition;

     .  timely completion and introduction of new product designs;

     .  the ability of TSMC, our primary  manufacturer,  and any additional
        third-party  manufacturers  to effectively  manufacture our new products
        in a timely manner;

     .  the quality of any new products;

     .  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors;

     .  market acceptance of our products and our customers' products; and

     .  availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of
        memory products.

     Our strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process
technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial
third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in
initial yield problems. New products that we introduce may not incorporate the
features and functionality demanded by PC OEMs, add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers and consumers of 3D graphics. In addition, we may not successfully
develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate
time to meet both the PC OEMs' design cycles and market demand. We have in the
past experienced delays in the development of some new products. Our failure to
successfully develop, introduce or achieve market acceptance for new 3D graphics
products would harm our business.

     Our failure to identify new product opportunities or develop new products
could harm our business.

     As markets for our 3D graphics processors develop and competition
increases, we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain
short and average selling prices will continue to decline. In particular, we
expect average selling prices and gross margins for our 3D graphics processors
to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases. As a result, we
will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to
maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins. In order for our 3D
graphics processors to achieve high volumes, leading PC OEMs and add-in board
and motherboard manufacturers must select our 3D graphics processor for design
into their products, and then successfully complete the designs of their
products and sell them. We may be unable to successfully

                                       18

<PAGE>

identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market in a timely
fashion any new products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any new products
we develop will be selected for design into PC OEMs' and add-in board and
motherboard manufacturers' products, that any new designs will be successfully
completed or that any new products will be sold. As the complexity of our
products and the manufacturing process for products increases, there is an
increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of
products and that there will be delays in the development, introduction or
volume shipment of our products. We may experience difficulties related to the
production of current or future products or other factors may delay the
introduction or volume sale of new products we developed. In addition, we may be
unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to
future products. Failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future
products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average
selling prices, reduced margins, and reduced demand for products or loss of
market share. In addition, technologies developed by others may render our 3D
graphics products non-competitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess
inventory, either of which would harm our business.

     We rely on third-party vendors to supply us tools for the development of
our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop
these products.

     In the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we
rely on third-party software development tools. While we currently are not
dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools, some or all of these
tools may not be readily available in the future. For example, we have
experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of
the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the
complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements
necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality
from 3D graphics products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the
software development tools available to us. If the software development tools we
use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands,
our business could suffer.

     Our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of
intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial costs
to us.

     The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and
pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions, which has resulted in
protracted and expensive litigation. The 3D graphics market in particular has
been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property
positions, and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive
intellectual property positions. In addition, from time to time we receive
notices alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property
rights owned by third parties. We expect that, as the number of issued hardware
and software patents increases, and as competition in our markets intensifies,
the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase. If
infringement claims are made against us, we may seek licenses under the
claimants' patents or other intellectual property rights. However, licenses may
not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a
license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur
substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products. Furthermore,
we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of
our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights.
We have agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims of infringement arising
out of sale of our products.

     Litigation by or against us or our customers concerning infringement would
likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our
technical and management personnel, whether or not the litigation results in a
favorable determination for us.

     We have in the past been subject to patent infringement suits, and we may
be subject to patent infringement suits brought by other parties in the future.
These future lawsuits could divert our resources and result in the payment of
substantial damages.

                                       19

<PAGE>

     We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property.

     We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets,
employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to
protect our intellectual property. As of August 28, 2001, we owned 52 issued
United States patents and 6 issued foreign patents, and have 104 United States
patent applications pending. Our issued patents have expiration dates from June
9, 2012 to December 6, 2019. As of August 28, 2001, our issued patents and
pending patent applications related to technology developed by us in connection
with the development of our products, including our 3D graphics processors. Our
pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In
addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or
may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may
harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop
substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our
trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our
intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology from
third parties for incorporation in our graphics processors, and expect to
continue to enter into license agreements for future products. These licenses
may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of
technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are
not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer.

     Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business.

     Our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins,
which entails having our existing and future products chosen as the 3D graphics
processors for hardware components or subassemblies designed by PC OEMs and
add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. Our add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers and major OEM customers typically introduce new system
configurations as often as twice per year, generally based on spring and fall
design cycles. Accordingly, our existing products must have competitive
performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such
performance characteristics in order to be included in new system
configurations. Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our
business. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a PC OEM's product can
be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a
particular product feature, which also could harm our business.

     Our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to
identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated
changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with
products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers,
including Intel and Microsoft. This would require us to invest significant time
and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant
standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry
standards for a significant period of time, our ability to achieve design wins
could suffer.

     We are dependent on the PC market and the slowdown in its growth may have a
negative impact on our business.

     During the first half of fiscal 2002, we derived most of our revenue from
the sale of products for use in the entire desktop PC market, from professional
workstations to low-cost PCs. We expect to continue to derive most of our
revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the entire desktop PC
market in the next several years. The PC market is characterized by rapidly
changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product
introductions and significant price competition. These factors result in short
product life cycles and regular reductions of average selling prices over the
life of a specific product. A reduction in sales of PCs, or a reduction in the
growth rate of PC sales, could reduce demand for our products. Moreover, changes
in demand could be large and sudden. Since PC manufacturers often build
inventories during periods of anticipated growth, they may be left with excess
inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product
transitions. In these cases, PC manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially
all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess
inventory has been absorbed. It is possible that the recent slowing of the
economy in the U.S. and international regions, which has negatively impacted
some PC manufacturers and led to some reductions in the demand for PCs, could
lead to reductions in inventory purchases by PC manufacturers. Any reduction in
the

                                       20

<PAGE>

demand for PCs generally, or for a particular product that incorporates our 3D
graphic processors, could harm our business.

     The acceptance of next generation products in business PC 3D graphics may
not continue to develop.

     Our success will depend in part upon the demand for performance 3D graphics
for business PC applications. The market for performance 3D graphics on business
PCs has only recently begun to emerge and is dependent on the future development
of, and substantial end-user and OEM demand for, 3D graphics functionality. As a
result, the market for business PC 3D graphics computing may not continue to
develop or may not grow at a rate sufficient to support our business. The
development of the market for performance 3D graphics on business PCs will in
turn depend on the development and availability of a large number of business PC
software applications that support or take advantage of performance 3D graphics
capabilities. Currently there are only a limited number of software applications
like this, most of which are games, and a broader base of software applications
may not develop in the near term or at all. Consequently, a broad market for
full function performance 3D graphics on business PCs may not develop. Our
business prospects will suffer if the market for business PC 3D graphics fails
to develop or develops more slowly than expected.

     We are dependent on a small number of customers and we are subject to order
and shipment uncertainties.

     We have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly
concentrated. We primarily sell our products to add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers and CEMs, which incorporate graphics products in the boards they
sell to PC OEMs and system builders. Sales to add-in board and motherboard
manufacturers and CEMs are primarily dependent on achieving design wins with
leading PC OEMs. The number of add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, CEMs
and leading PC OEMs is limited. We expect that a small number of add-in board
and motherboard manufacturers and CEMs directly, and a small number of PC OEMs
indirectly, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue
for the foreseeable future. As a result, our business could be harmed by the
loss of business from PC OEMs or add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and
CEMs. In addition, revenue from add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, CEMs
and PC OEMs that have directly or indirectly accounted for significant revenue
in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue, or may not reach
or exceed historical levels in any future period.

     Our business may be harmed by instability in Asia due to the concentration
of customers who are located or have substantial operations in Asia, including
Taiwan. The People's Republic of China and Taiwan have in the past experienced
and currently are experiencing strained relations. A worsening of these
relations or the development of hostilities between the two could result in
disruptions in Taiwan and possibly other areas of Asia, which could harm our
business. In addition, if foreign relation matters strain the relationship
between the U.S. and The People's Republic of China, situations in Asia could
remain unstable. While we believe political instability in Asia has not
adversely affected our business, because of our reliance on companies with
operations in Asia, continued economic and political instability in Asia might
harm it.

     We may be unable to manage our growth and, as a result, may be unable to
successfully implement our strategy.

     Our rapid growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a
significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. As of
July 29, 2001, we had 907 employees as compared to 796 employees as of January
28, 2001. We expect that the number of our employees will increase substantially
over the next 12 months. Our future growth, if any, will depend on our ability
to continue to implement and improve operational, financial and management
information and control systems on a

                                       21

<PAGE>

timely basis, as well as our ability to maintain effective cost controls.
Further, we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various
customers and other third parties. Our systems, procedures or controls may not
be adequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to
achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our strategy.

     We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could
harm our business.

     Our performance will be substantially dependent on the performance of our
executive officers and key employees. None of our officers or employees is bound
by an employment agreement, and our relationships with these officers and
employees are, therefore, at will. We do not have "key person" life insurance
policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our
executive officers, technical personnel or other key employees, particularly
Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would harm our
business. Our success will depend on our ability to identify, hire, train and
retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Our failure to
attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm
our business.

     We depend on third-party fabrications to produce our products.

     We do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do
not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Our products require wafers
manufactured with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques. We
utilize TSMC to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent
contractors to perform assembly, test and packaging. We depend on these
suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient
to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable
manufacturing yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis.
These manufacturers may be unable to meet our near-term or long-term
manufacturing requirements. We obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order
basis and TSMC has no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum
quantities of product. TSMC fabricates wafers for other companies, including
certain of our competitors, and could choose to prioritize capacity for other
users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. Because the
lead-time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing
partner could be several quarters, there is no readily available alternative
source of supply for any specific product. We believe that long-term market
acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with TSMC and
any other manufacturers used by us to ensure adequate product supply to respond
to customer demand.

     Because of our reliance on TSMC, our business may be harmed by political
instability in Taiwan, including the worsening of the strained relations between
The People's Republic of China and Taiwan, or if relations between the U.S. and
The People's Republic of China are strained due to foreign relations events.
Furthermore, any substantial disruption in our suppliers' operations, either as
a result of a natural disaster, political unrest, economic instability,
equipment failure or other cause, could harm our business.

     We are dependent primarily on TSMC and we expect in the future to continue
to be dependent upon third-party manufacturers to do the following:

     .    produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing
          yields;

     .    deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing
          subcontractors on a timely basis; and

     .    allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to
          meet our needs.

     Our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total
production capacity of TSMC. Although our products are designed using TSMC's
process design rules, TSMC may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable
yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis and/or at an
acceptable cost. Additionally, TSMC may not continue to devote resources to the
production of our products, or to advance the process design technologies on
which the manufacturing of our products are based. Any difficulties like these
would harm our business.

                                       22

<PAGE>

     Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for both or either
existing or new products would reduce our product supply and harm our business.

     Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design,
which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is
proprietary to the manufacturer. Since low yields may result from either design
or process technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined
or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to
identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used. As a
result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production
process, and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and
communication between us and the manufacturer.

     The risk of low yields is compounded by the offshore location of most of
our manufacturers, increasing the effort and time required to identify,
communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. Because of our potentially
limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers, any
decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit
costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers.
This could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross
profit. Our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable
manufacturing yields in the future. Our inability to achieve planned yields from
our wafer manufacturers could harm our business. We also face the risk of
product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing
defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process. In
the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall,
our business could suffer.

     Failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could
affect our ability to compete effectively.

     Our strategy is to utilize the most advanced process technology appropriate
for our products and available from commercial third-party foundries. Use of
advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems.
Manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require
significant expenditures for research and development. We continuously evaluate
the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to
improve performance and reduce costs. We have migrated to the .15-micron
technology with the GeForce3 family of graphics processors, and we believe that
the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be
important to our competitive position. Other companies in the industry have
experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes and,
consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries and
increased expense levels. We may experience similar difficulties and the
corresponding negative effects. Moreover, we are dependent on our relationships
with our third-party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes
successfully. We may be unable to migrate to new manufacturing process
technologies successfully or on a timely basis.

     The 3D graphics industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to
compete.

     The market for 3D graphics processors for PCs in which we compete is
intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change,
evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe
that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth
of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels,
backward-forward software support, conformity to industry standard APIs,
manufacturing capabilities, price of graphics processors and total system costs
of add-in boards and motherboards. We expect competition to increase both from
existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less
costly than our 3D graphics processors or may provide better performance or
additional features not provided by our products. We may be unable to compete
successfully in the emerging PC graphics market.

     Our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend
to provide 3D graphics solutions for the PC market. Our competitors include the
following:

                                       23

<PAGE>

     .    suppliers of graphics add-in boards that utilize their internally
          developed graphics chips, such as ATI Technologies Inc. and Matrox
          Electronics Systems Ltd.;

     .    suppliers of integrated core logic chipsets that incorporate 2D and 3D
          graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as
          Intel, Silicon Integrated Systems and Via Technologies, Inc.;

     .    suppliers of mobile graphics processors that incorporate 2D or 3D
          graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as
          ATI, Trident Microsystems, Inc. and the joint venture of a division of
          SONICblue Incorporated (formerly S3 Incorporated) and Via
          Technologies, Inc.;

     .    companies that have traditionally focused on the professional market
          and vide high end 3D solutions for PCs and workstations, including
          3Dlabs, SGI and ATI; and

     .    companies that focus on the video game market, such as Imagination
          Technologies and ST Microelectronics.

     If and to the extent we offer products outside of the 3D graphics processor
market, we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as
from companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately
predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter.

     We may compete with Intel in the integrated low-cost chipset market.

     Historically, Intel developed 3D graphics chipsets that are targeted at the
low-cost PC market. Intel has significantly greater resources than we do, and
our products may not compete effectively against future products introduced by
Intel. In addition, we may be unable to compete effectively against Intel or
Intel may introduce additional products that are competitive with our products
in either performance or price or both. We expect Intel to continue to do the
following:

     .    invest heavily in research and development and new manufacturing
          facilities;

     .    maintain its position as the largest manufacturer of PC
          microprocessors;

     .    increasingly dominate the PC platform; and

     .    promote its product offerings through advertising campaigns designed
          to engender brand loyalty among PC users.

     Intel may in the future develop graphics add-in cards or graphics-enabled
motherboards that could directly compete with graphics add-in cards or
graphics-enabled motherboards that our customers may develop. In addition, due
to the widespread industry acceptance of Intel's microprocessor architecture and
interface architecture, including its accelerated graphics port, or AGP, and
Intel's intellectual property position with respect to such architecture, Intel
exercises significant influence over the PC industry generally. Any significant
modifications by Intel to the AGP, the microprocessor or core logic components
or other aspects of the PC microprocessor architecture could result in
incompatibility with our technology, which would harm our business. In addition,
any delay in the public release of information relating to modifications like
this could harm our business.

     We are dependent on third parties for assembly, testing and packaging of
our products.

     Our graphics processors are assembled and tested by Siliconware Precision
Industries Company Ltd., ChipPAC Incorporated and Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these
subcontractors. As a result of our dependence on third-party subcontractors for
assembly, testing and packaging of our products, we do not directly control
product delivery schedules or product quality. Any product shortages or quality
assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing
of our products and could harm our business. Due to the amount of time typically
required to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant
delays in the shipment of our

                                       24

<PAGE>


products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or
test our products or components. Any delays in delivery of our products could
harm our business.

     We are subject to risks associated with product defects and
incompatibilities.

     Products as complex as those offered by us may contain defects or failures
when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are
released. We have in the past discovered software defects and incompatibilities
with customers' hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or
lost revenue to correct any new defects in the future. Errors in new products or
releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of
market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. Our products typically go
through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and
distribution. As a result, our products may contain defects or flaws that are
undetected prior to volume production and distribution. If these defects or
flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution, we
may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the
affected products in the field. These costs could be significant and could
adversely affect our business and operating results. The production and
distribution of defective products could harm our business.

     We may not be successful in producing the processors in volumes required
for the Microsoft Xbox product and, even if we do successfully produce these
processors in the volumes required, we may not achieve profit margins consistent
with those of our other products.

     The Xbox Graphics Processing Unit and Xbox Media Communications Processor
are new, complicated processors that have not been produced in volume. Both
processors have increased in complexity and features from what was contemplated
at the time we entered into the agreement with Microsoft. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to produce these processors in the volume and
within the required time frames or that we will be able to produce these
processors consistent with profit margins achieved on our other products.
Finally, there can be no assurance that the Xbox program will be commercially
successful. If any of the aforementioned risks occur, our business may suffer
and our stock price may decline.

     We recently moved into new headquarters. If we are unable to sublease our
excess space, we will have increased operating expenses which may have a
negative impact on our net income.

     We moved into new headquarters in June 2001, but we are still obligated to
pay rent for our previous office space. Since we relocated, we have been trying
to locate a subtenant for our previous office space and a subtenant for one of
the buildings that will comprise part of our new office complex. We may be
unable to secure subtenants for both spaces due to the decrease in demand for
commercial rental space in Santa Clara, California, as a result of the declining
economy. If we are unable to secure subtenants or if the rental values in Santa
Clara, California, decrease such that even if we found subtenants we would still
be obligated to pay a portion of the rent at both locations, our operating
expenses will increase, perhaps substantially, which will have a negative impact
on our net income. In addition, if we do not enter into a sublease for our
former office space, we will have to write-off unutilized leasehold improvements
and furniture and fixtures associated with that space, which will adversely
affect our net income.

     We are subject to risks associated with international operations.

     Our reliance on foreign third-party manufacturing, assembly, testing and
packaging operations subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting
business outside of the United States, including the following:

     .    unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory
          requirements;

     .    delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for
          certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and
          restrictions;

     .    longer payment cycles;

                                       25

<PAGE>



     .   imposition of additional taxes and penalties;

     .   the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and

     .   other factors beyond our control.

     We also are subject to general political risks in connection with our
international trade relationships. In addition, the laws of certain foreign
countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including
various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property
rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This makes the
possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. Currently, all
of our arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and
payment in U.S. dollars, and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging
activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency
exchange rates could harm our business in the future.

     The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature.

     The semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by the
following factors:

     .    rapid technological change;

     .    cyclical market patterns;

     .    significant average selling price erosion;

     .    fluctuating inventory levels;

     .    alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints; and

     .    variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant
          expenditures for capital equipment and product development.

     In addition, the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at
various times, characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated
erosion of average selling prices. We may experience substantial
period-to-period fluctuations in results of operations due to general
semiconductor industry conditions.

     Failure in implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could
adversely affect our operations.

     In December 1999, we began the implementation of an SAP A.G. system as our
enterprise resource planning or ERP system to replace our information systems in
business, finance, operations and service. The first phase of the implementation
was successfully completed in June 2000 and our operations are fully functioning
under the new ERP system. Future phases of the implementation are expected to
occur throughout fiscal 2002. We are heavily dependent upon the proper
functioning of our internal systems to conduct our business. System failure or
malfunctioning may result in disruptions of operations and inability to process
transactions. Our results of operations and financial position could be
adversely affected if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect to system
operations or future implementation.

     Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our
agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.

     Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our
outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:

     .    the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred
          stock without prior shareholder approval;

     .    the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;

     .    a classified board of directors; and



                                       26

<PAGE>


     .    advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder
          proposals.

     On March 5, 2000, we entered into a licensing and development agreement
with Microsoft that included a grant to Microsoft of first and last rights of
refusal over any offer we receive to purchase 30% or more of the outstanding
shares of our common stock. The provision could also delay or prevent a change
in control of our company.

     Rising energy costs and power system shortages in California may result in
increased operating expenses and reduced net income.

     California has been experiencing an energy crisis and has experienced
significant power shortages during the last year. As a result, energy costs in
California, including natural gas and electricity, have increased significantly
over the year and may still be rising. Because our principal operating
facilities are located in California, our operating expenses may increase
significantly if this trend continues. In addition, California has on some
occasions implemented, and may in the future continue to implement, rolling
blackouts throughout the state, including the county where we have our principal
offices. If blackouts interrupt our power supply, we may be temporarily unable
to operate and any such interruption could harm our business.

     Our stock price may continue to experience large short-term fluctuations.

     The price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly. These price
fluctuations have been rapid and severe. The price of our common stock may
continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors, such as the recent
decline in some economic indicators in the U.S., related to the general
volatility that currently exists in the market or due to a variety of company
specific factors, including quarter to quarter variations in our operating
results, shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities
analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk factors. In the
past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's stock,
securities class action litigation has been initiated against the issuing
company. This type of litigation could result in substantial cost and a
diversion of management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse
effect on our revenues and earnings. Any adverse determination in this type of
litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. See "Certain
Business Risks--Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate."

     We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits
of future business acquisitions that could hurt our ability to grow our business
and sell our products.

     In the future we may acquire or invest in other businesses that offer
products, services and technologies that we believe would help expand or enhance
our products and services or help expand our distribution channels. If we were
to make such an acquisition or investment, the following risks could impair our
ability to grow our business and develop new products and, ultimately, could
impair our ability to sell our products:

     .    difficulty in combining the technology, operations or work force of
          the acquired business;

     .    disruption of our on-going businesses;

     .    difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits
          of the transaction;

     .    difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and
          policies; and

     .    possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a
          result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel.

     In addition, the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in
cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock. If
the consideration is paid with our common stock,

                                       27

<PAGE>

existing stockholders would be further diluted. Goodwill and all identifiable
intangible assets that have an indeterminable life associated with future
acquisitions will be recognized as assets but not amortized as in accordance
with the recent Financial Accounting Statement 142. These assets will be
assessed for impairment on an annual basis. Identifiable intangible assets that
have a determinable life will continue to be segregated from goodwill and
amortized over their useful lives.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On February 22, 2000, Graphiques Matrox, Inc. and Systemes Electroniques
Matrox Ltd. (collectively "Matrox") filed suit against us in the Superior Court,
Judicial District of Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada. The suit alleged that
we improperly solicited and recruited Matrox employees and encouraged Matrox
employees to breach their Matrox confidentiality and/or non-competition
agreements. The suit by Matrox sought, among other things, certain injunctive
relief. The trial of this matter occurred during April, 2001. On July 12, 2001,
the court issued its ruling in favor of us and dismissed all of Matrox's claims.
Matrox has not appealed this ruling and the time for appeal passed August 13,
2001.

     Sunonwealth Electric Machine Industry Co., Ltd. filed a complaint against
us in the United States District Court for the Central District of California
for infringement of US Patent Nos. 6,109,892 and 6,114,785. The underlying case
is Sunonwealth v. Adda Corporation, et al, filed in the United States District
Court for the Central District on October 19, 2000. Both cases have been
consolidated. The patents are for a positioning device for a sensor element of a
miniature fan. We purchased these fans from Adda. Adda has agreed to defend us
and to pay any judgment rendered against us as well as the cost of any
settlement to the extent that our liability in such settlement arises from
patent infringement resulting from its purchase of products from Adda.

     On August 3, 2001 the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued its
decision in a patent infringement action originally brought in 1998 by S3
Incorporated (now SONICblue Incorporated). The decision vacated the district's
court summary judgment in favor of us and dismissal of the action relative to
certain disputed claims and remanded the matter back to the district court.
Under a previous settlement agreement with S3, we agreed to pay up to $2.0
million if S3's appeal of the district court judgment was decided in favor of
S3. We made a payment of $1.9 million in August 2001 to fully satisfy our
obligation under the settlement.

     In addition, we may be subject to litigation in the future. See "Certain
Business Risks - Litigation by or against us or our customers concerning
infringement would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the
efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not the litigation
results in a favorable determination for us." From time to time, we are also
subject to claims in the ordinary course of business, none of which in our view
would have a material adverse impact on our business or financial position if
resolved unfavorably.

                             STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

     Section 4.   Place of Meetings. Meetings of the stockholders of the
corporation may be held at such place, either within or without the State of
Delaware, as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. The
Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall

communication as provided under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     Section 5.   Annual Meeting.

          (a)     The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, for
the purpose of election of directors and for such other business as may lawfully
come before it, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors. Nominations of persons for election
to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be
considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of


                                       i.

<PAGE>

stockholders: (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting of
stockholders; (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (iii) by
any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time
of giving of notice provided for in the following paragraph, who is entitled to
vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in
Section 5.

          (b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall
be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. For
nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by
a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of Section 5(a) of these Bylaws, (i) the
stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of
the corporation, (ii) such other business must be a proper matter for
stockholder action under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, (iii) if the
stockholder, or the beneficial owner on whose behalf any such proposal or
nomination is made, has provided the corporation with a Solicitation Notice (as
defined in this Section 5(b)), such stockholder or beneficial owner must, in the
case of a proposal, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to
holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's voting shares required
under applicable law to carry any such proposal, or, in the case of a nomination
or nominations, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of
a percentage of the corporation's voting shares reasonably believed by such
stockholder or beneficial owner to be sufficient to elect the nominee or
nominees proposed to be nominated by such stockholder, and must, in either case,
have included in such materials the Solicitation Notice, and (iv) if no
Solicitation Notice relating thereto has been timely provided pursuant to this
section, the stockholder or beneficial owner proposing such business or
nomination must not have solicited a number of proxies sufficient to have
required the delivery of such a Solicitation Notice under this Section 5. To be
timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the ninetieth (90/th/) day nor earlier than the close of business on
the one hundred twentieth (120/th/) day prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the
date of the annual meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to or
delayed by more than thirty (30) days after the anniversary of the preceding
year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so
delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth
(120/th/) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of
business on the later of the ninetieth (90/th/) day prior to such annual meeting
or the tenth (10/th/) day following the day on which public announcement of the
date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the public announcement of
an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of
a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set
forth: (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposed to nominate for
election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person
that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of
directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case
pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "1934 Act") and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written
consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a
director if elected); (B) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes
to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be
brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the
meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the
beneficial owner, if any, on


                                       ii.

<PAGE>

whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the stockholder giving the
notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or
proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on
the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number
of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such
stockholder and such beneficial owner, and (iii) whether either such stockholder
or beneficial owner intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to
holders of, in the case of the proposal, at least the percentage of the
corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal
or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, a sufficient number of holders
of the corporation's voting shares to elect such nominee or nominees (an
affirmative statement of such intent, a "Solicitation Notice").

          (c) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 5(b) of
these Bylaws to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be
elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is
no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the
size of the increased Board of Directors made by the corporation at least one
hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual
meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 5 shall also be
considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions
created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of
business on the tenth (10/th/) day following the day on which such public
announcement is first made by the corporation.

          (d)  Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 5 shall be eligible to serve as directors
and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall
have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Section 5. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Chairman of the
meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any
business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made, or proposed, as the
case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if
any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to
declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall not be presented for
stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.

          (e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, in
order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy
statement and form of proxy for a stockholders' meeting, stockholders must
provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act.
Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to
request inclusion of proposals in the corporation proxy statement pursuant to
Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act.

          (f)  For purposes of this Section 5, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated
Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the
corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13,
14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act.

     Section 6.  Special Meetings.

          (a)    Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be
called, for any purpose or purposes, by (i) the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer or (iii) the Board of Directors
pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized
directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized
directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of
Directors for adoption), and shall be held on such date, at such time, and at
such place, if there is to be such a place, as the Board of Directors, shall
fix. At any time or times that the corporation is subject to Section 2115(b) of
the California General Corporation Law ("CGCL"), stockholders holding five
percent (5%) or more of the outstanding shares shall have the right to call a
special meeting of stockholders as set forth in Section 18(c) herein.

          (b)    If a special meeting is properly called by any person or
persons other than the Board of Directors, the request shall be in writing,
specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and
shall be delivered personally or sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief
Executive Officer, or the Secretary of the corporation. No business may be
transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The
Board of Directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting,
which shall be held not less than thirty-five (35) nor more than one hundred
twenty (120) days after the date of the receipt of the request. Upon
determination of the time and place of the meeting, the officer receiving the
request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in
accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws. If the notice is
not given within one hundred (100) days after the receipt of the request, the
person or persons properly requesting the meeting may set the time and place of
the meeting and give the notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph (b) shall
be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of
stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held.

          (c)    Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors
may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be
elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (i) by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the
corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided
for in these Bylaws who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who
complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 6(c). In the event
the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of
electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder
may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such
position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the
stockholder's notice required by Section 5(b) of these Bylaws shall be delivered
to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not
earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day
prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the
later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such meeting or the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the
special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be
elected at such meeting. In no


                                       iv.

<PAGE>

event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of a special meeting
commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described
above.

     Section 7.  Notice Of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law or the
certificate of incorporation, notice, given in writing or by electronic
transmission, of each meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten
(10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, such notice to specify the place,
if any, date and hour, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes
of the meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at
any such meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address
as it appears on the records of the corporation. Notice of the time, place, if
any, and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed
by the person entitled to notice thereof, or by electronic transmission by such
person, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any
stockholder by his attendance thereat in person, by remote communication, if
applicable, or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by
the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had
been given.

     Section 8.  Quorum. At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise
provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws,
the presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy
duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock
entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In
the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time
to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be
transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or
convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact
business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by
statute or by applicable stock exchange or Nasdaq rules, or by the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in all matters other than the election of
directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person, by
remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote generally on the subject matter shall be the act of the
stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
votes of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable,
or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the
election of directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series is
required, except where otherwise provided by the statute or by the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a majority of the outstanding shares of such
class or classes or series, present in person, by remote communication, if
applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized, shall constitute a quorum
entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Except where
otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the
election of directors) of shares of


                                       v.

<PAGE>

such class or classes or series present in person, by remote communication, if
applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such
class or classes or series.

     Section 9.  Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings. Any meeting of
stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time
either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares
casting votes present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or
represented by proxy at the meeting. When a meeting is adjourned to another time
or place, if any, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time
and place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is
for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

     Section 10. Voting Rights. For the purpose of determining those
stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as
otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the stock
records of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 12 of
these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Every
person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either
in person by remote communication, if applicable or by an agent or agents
authorized by a proxy granted in accordance with Delaware law. An agent so
appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three (3)
years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period.

     Section 11. Joint Owners of Stock. If shares or other securities having
voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether
fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants
by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same
fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given
written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or
order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided,
their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only
one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the
majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is
evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in
question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for
relief as provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 217(b). If
the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in
unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c)
shall be a majority or even-split in interest.

     Section 12. List of Stockholders. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at
least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in
the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, (a) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
access to such list is


                                       vi.

<PAGE>

provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours,
at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the
corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the
corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the corporation. The list shall be open to
examination of any stockholder during the time of the meeting as provided by
law.

     Section 13.  Action Without Meeting.

          (a)  Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation,
any action required by statute to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
the stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, or by electronic
transmission, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders
of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

          (b)  Every written consent or electronic transmission shall bear the
date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written
consent or electronic transmission shall be effective to take the corporate
action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated
consent delivered to the corporation in the manner herein required, written
consents or electronic transmission signed by a sufficient number of
stockholders to take action are delivered to the corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or
an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a
corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested.

          (c)  Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing or by electronic transmission and
who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that
written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take action
were delivered to the corporation as provided in Section 228 (c) of the Delaware
General Corporation Law. If the action which is consented to is such as would
have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the Delaware
General Corporation Law if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a
meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in
lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of
stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228
of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

          (d)  A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consent to
an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a
person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be
deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this section,
provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission sets
forth or is delivered with information from which the corporation can determine
(i) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was
transmitted by the

                                      vii.

<PAGE>

stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the
stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or
proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram, cablegram
or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram, cablegram or
electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which
such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram or other
electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such
consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered
to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of
Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the
corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a corporation's registered office
shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given
by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission may be otherwise
delivered to the principal place of business of the corporation or to an officer
or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner
provided by resolution of the board of directors of the corporation. Any copy,
facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for
which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or
other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original in
writing.

          (e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by written consent
or by electronic transmission may be taken following the closing of the initial
public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), covering the offer and sale
of Common Stock of the corporation to the public (the "Initial Public
Offering").

     Section 14.  Organization.

          (a)  At every meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, or, if a Chairman has not been appointed or is absent, the President,
or, if the President is absent, a chairman of the meeting chosen by a majority
in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy,
shall act as chairman. The Secretary, or, in his absence, an Assistant Secretary
directed to do so by the President, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

          (b)  The Board of Directors of the corporation shall be entitled to
make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it
shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and
regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall
have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures
and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary,
appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including,
without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting,
rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of
those present, limitations on participation in such meeting to stockholders of
record of the corporation and their duly authorized and constituted proxies and
such other persons as the chairman shall permit, restrictions on entry to the
meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the
time allotted to questions or comments

                                      viii.

<PAGE>

by participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for
balloting on matters which are to be voted on by ballot. The date and time of
the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders
will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting. Unless and to the
extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
rules of parliamentary procedure.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    DIRECTORS

     Section 15.  Number and Term of Office. The authorized number of directors

of the corporation shall be fixed in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the
Certificate of Incorporation. If for any cause, the directors shall not have
been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as
convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in
the manner provided in these Bylaws.

     Section 16.  Powers. The powers of the corporation shall be exercised,  its
business conducted and its property controlled by the Board of Directors, except
as may be otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation.

     Section 17.  Classes Of Directors. Subject to the rights of the holders of
any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified
circumstances, following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the
directors shall be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II
and Class III. Directors shall be assigned to each class in accordance with a
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. At the first annual
meeting of stockholders following the closing of the Initial Public Offering,
the term of office of the Class I directors shall expire and Class I directors
shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the second annual meeting of
stockholders following the Closing of the Initial Public Offering, the term of
office of the Class II directors shall expire and Class II directors shall be
elected for a full term of three years. At the third annual meeting of
stockholders following the Closing of the Initial Public Offering, the term of
office of the Class III directors shall expire and Class III directors shall be
elected for a full term of three years. At each succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to
succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each director
shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his
death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent
director.

     Section 18.  Vacancies.

         (a)   Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and
subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any
vacancies on the Board of

                                       ix.

<PAGE>

Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other
causes and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
number of directors shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by
resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be
filled by stockholders, be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of
Directors. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall
hold office for the remainder of the full term of the director for which the
vacancy was created or occurred and until such director's successor shall have
been elected and qualified. A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed
to exist under this Bylaw in the case of the death, removal or resignation of
any director.

          (b) If at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created
directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority
of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the
Delaware Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or
stockholders holding at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of the
shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors,
summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly
created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then
in offices as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by Section 211 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

          (c) At any time or times that the corporation is subject to Section
2115(b) of the CGCL, if, after the filling of any vacancy, the directors then in
office who have been elected by stockholders shall constitute less than a
majority of the directors then in office, then

               (1) Any holder or holders of an aggregate of five percent (5%) or
more of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to
vote for those directors may call a special meeting of stockholders; or

               (2) The Superior Court of the proper county shall, upon
application of such stockholder or stockholders, summarily order a special
meeting of stockholders, to be held to elect the entire board, all in accordance
with Section 305(c) of the CGCL. The term of office of any director shall
terminate upon that election of a successor.

     Section 19. Resignation. Any director may resign at any time by delivering
his or her notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Secretary,
such resignation to specify whether it will be effective at a particular time,
upon receipt by the Secretary or at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. If
no such specification is made, it shall be deemed effective at the pleasure of
the Board of Directors. When one or more directors shall resign from the Board
of Directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in
office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such
vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or
resignations shall become effective, and each Director so chosen shall hold
office for the unexpired portion of the term of the Director whose place shall
be vacated and until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.

     Section 20. Removal.

          (a) Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred
stock the Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed from
office at any time (i) with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock
of the corporation entitled to vote generally at an election of directors or
(ii) without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of sixty-six and
two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all the then-outstanding
shares of voting stock of the corporation, entitled to vote generally at an
election of directors.

     Section 21. Meetings

          (a) Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of the Board of Directors
shall be held immediately before or after the annual meeting of stockholders and
at the place where such meeting is held. No notice of an annual meeting of the
Board of Directors shall be necessary and such meeting shall be held for the
purpose of electing officers and transacting such other business as may lawfully
come before it.

          (b) Regular Meetings. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided,
regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held in the office of the
corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 hereof. Unless

meetings of the Board of Directors.

          (c) Special Meetings. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate
of Incorporation, special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any
time and place within or without the State of Delaware whenever called by the
Chairman of the Board, the President or any two of the directors.

          (d) Meetings by Electronic Communications Equipment. Any member of
the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may participate in a
meeting by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in a meeting by such means shall constitute presence in person at
such meeting.

          (e) Notice of Special Meetings. Notice of the time and place of all
special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be orally or in writing, by
telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology
designed to record and communicate messages, facsimile, telegraph or telex, or
by electronic mail or other electronic means, during normal business hours, at
least twenty-four (24) hours before the date and time of the meeting. If notice
is sent by US mail, it shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, at
least three (3) days before the date of the meeting. Notice of any meeting may
be waived in writing, or by electronic


                                       xi.

transmission, at any time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any
director by attendance thereat, except when the director attends the meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.

          (f) Waiver of Notice. The transaction of all business at any meeting
of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, however called or noticed,
or wherever held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after
regular call and notice, if a quorum be present and if, either before or after
the meeting, each of the directors not present shall sign a written waiver of
notice. All such waivers shall be filed with the corporate records or made a
part of the minutes of the meeting.

     Section 22. Quorum and Voting.

          (a) Unless the Certificate of Incorporation requires a greater number,
and except with respect to indemnification questions arising under Section 43
hereof, for which a quorum shall be one-third of the exact number of directors
fixed from time to time, a quorum of the Board of Directors shall consist of a
majority of the exact number of directors fixed from time to time by the Board
of Directors in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation; provided,
however, at any meeting whether a quorum be present or otherwise, a majority of
the directors present may adjourn from time to time until the time fixed for the
next regular meeting of the Board of Directors, without notice other than by
announcement at the meeting.

          (b) At each meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is
present, all questions and business shall be determined by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the directors present, unless a different vote be required by
law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

     Section 23. Action Without Meeting. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted
to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof
may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors or
committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic
transmission, and such writing or writings or transmission or transmissions are
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.
Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form
and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic
form.

     Section 24. Fees and Compensation. Directors shall be entitled to such
compensation for their services as may be approved by the Board of Directors,
including, if so approved, by resolution of the Board of Directors, a fixed sum
and expenses of attendance, if any, for attendance at each regular or special
meeting of the Board of Directors and at any meeting of a committee of the Board
of Directors. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any
director from serving the corporation in any other capacity as an officer,
agent, employee, or otherwise and receiving compensation therefor.

     Section 25. Committees.

          (a) Executive Committee. The Board of Directors may appoint an
Executive Committee to consist of one (1) or more members of the Board of
Directors. The Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by law and provided
in the resolution of the Board of Directors shall have and may exercise all the
powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business
and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to
be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have
the power or authority in reference to (i) approving or adopting, or
recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the
Delaware General Corporation Law to be submitted to stockholders for approval,
or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing any bylaw of the corporation.

          (b) Other Committees. The Board of Directors may, from time to time,
appoint such other committees as may be permitted by law. Such other committees
appointed by the Board of Directors shall consist of one (1) or more members of
the Board of Directors and shall have such powers and perform such duties as may
be prescribed by the resolution or resolutions creating such committees, but in
no event shall any such committee have the powers denied to the Executive
Committee in these Bylaws.

          (c) Term. Each member of a committee of the Board of Directors shall
serve a term on the committee coexistent with such member's term on the Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors, subject to any requirements of any
outstanding series of Preferred Stock, and the provisions of subsections (a) or
(b) of this Bylaw may at any time increase or decrease the number of members of
a committee or terminate the existence of a committee. The membership of a
committee member shall terminate on the date of his death or voluntary

unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the
meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.

pursuant to this Section 25 shall be held at such times and places as are
determined by the Board of Directors, or by any such committee, and when notice
thereof has been given to each member of such committee, no further notice of
such regular meetings need be given thereafter. Special meetings of any such
committee may be held at any place which has been determined from time to time
by such committee, and may be called by any director who is a member of such
committee, upon notice to the members of such committee of the time and place of
such special meeting given in

time before or after the meeting and will be waived by any director by
attendance thereat, except when the director attends such special meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the resolutions
authorizing the creation of the committee, a majority of the authorized number
of members of any such committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business, and the act of a majority of those present at any meeting at which
a quorum is present shall be the act of such committee.

of the Board of Directors, or, if a Chairman has not been appointed or is

Secretary directed to do so by the President, shall act as secretary of the

the corporation. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be
facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or
whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased
to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is
issued, it may be issued with the same effect as if he were such officer,
transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue. Each certificate shall state
upon the face or back thereof, in full or in summary, all of the powers,
designations, preferences, and rights, and the limitations or restrictions of
the shares authorized to be issued or shall, except as otherwise required by
law, set forth on the face or back a statement that the corporation will furnish
without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of
each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after
the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the corporation shall send to
the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information
required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to this section or
otherwise required by law or with respect to this section a statement that the
corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the
powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other
special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

     Section 35. Lost Certificates. A new certificate or certificates shall be
issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the
corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be
lost, stolen, or destroyed. The corporation may require, as a condition
precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the owner of
such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or certificates, or the owner's
legal representative, to agree to indemnify the


                                      xvii.

<PAGE>

corporation in such manner as it shall require or to give the corporation a
surety bond in such form and amount as it may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

     Section 36. Transfers.

          (a) Transfers of record of shares of stock of the corporation shall be
made only upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or by attorney duly
authorized, and upon the surrender of a properly endorsed certificate or

of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not

     Section 37. Fixing Record Dates.

          (a) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date,
which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date
shall, subject to applicable law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten
(10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment
of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting.

          (b) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60)
days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business
on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating

recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner
of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not be
bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or
shares on the part of any other person whether or not it shall have express or
other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

                       OTHER SECURITIES OF THE CORPORATION

     Section 39. Execution of Other Securities. All bonds, debentures and other
corporate securities of the corporation, other than stock certificates (covered
in Section 34), may be signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the
President or any Vice President, or such other person as may be authorized by
the Board of Directors, and the corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile
of such seal imprinted thereon and attested by the signature of the Secretary or
an Assistant Secretary, or the Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer or an
Assistant Treasurer; provided, however, that where any such bond, debenture or
other corporate security shall be authenticated by the manual signature, or
where permissible facsimile signature, of a trustee under an indenture pursuant
to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the
signatures of the persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond,
debenture or other corporate security may be the imprinted facsimile of the
signatures of such persons. Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond,
debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid,
shall be signed by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation or
such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear
imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer
who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate
security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon or on any such
interest coupon, shall have ceased to be such officer before the bond, debenture
or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered,
such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by
the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the
same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to
be such officer of the corporation.

                                   ARTICLE IX

property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law.

     Section 41. Dividend Reserve. Before payment of any dividend, there may be
set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum
or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in their absolute
discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for
equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the
corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall think
conducive to the interests of the corporation, and the Board of Directors may
modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

          Section 43. Indemnification of Directors, Executive Officers, Other
Officers, Employees and Other Agents.

               (a) Directors and Executive Officers. The corporation shall
indemnify its directors and executive officers (for the purposes of this Article
XI, "executive officers" shall have the meaning defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated
under the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General
Corporation Law or any other applicable law; provided, however, that the
corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual
contracts with its directors and executive officers; and, provided, further,
that the corporation shall not be required to indemnify any director or
executive officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made
by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the
corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its
sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the
Delaware General Corporation Law or any other applicable law or (iv) such
indemnification is required to be made under subsection (d).

               (b) Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents. The corporation
shall have power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as
set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law or any other applicable law.
The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of
whether indemnification shall be given to any such person (other than as
specified in clause (a) above) to such officers or other persons as the Board of
Directors shall determine.

               (c) Expenses. The corporation shall advance to any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or executive
officer, of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director or executive officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final
disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses
incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with such proceeding
provided, however, that if the Delaware General Corporate Law requires, an
advancement of expenses incurred by a director or an executive officer in his or
her capacity as a director or an executive officer (and not in any other
capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including,
without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon
delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an

                                       xx.

<PAGE>

"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication")
that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under
this Bylaw or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph
(e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an executive
officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that such executive
officer is or was a director of the corporation, in which event this paragraph
shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly
made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to the proceeding,
even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a
majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if
there are no such directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal
counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party
at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that
such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.

          (d) Enforcement. Without the necessity of entering into an express
contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and executive
officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be
effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the
corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification
or advances granted by this Bylaw to a director or executive officer shall be
enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of
competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is
denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within
ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action,
if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the
corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the
claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the
Delaware General Corporation Law or any other applicable law for the corporation
to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim
by an executive officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason
of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation)
for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any
such action clear and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or
in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board
of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law or any
other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including
its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the
claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to
the action or create a presumption that claimant has not

                                      xxi.

<PAGE>

met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or
executive officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of
expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or executive officer
is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under
this Article XI or otherwise shall be on the corporation.

               (e) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person
by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may
have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity
and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is
specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of
its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and
advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or by any other applicable law.

               (f) Survival of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by
this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person.

               (g) Insurance. To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, or any other applicable law, the corporation, upon
approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any
person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw.

               (h) Amendments. Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall
only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect
at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is
the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.

               (i) Saving Clause. If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to
the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that
shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this Section
43 shall be invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions of
another jurisdiction, then the corporation shall indemnify each director and
executive officer to the full extent under any other applicable law.

               (j) Certain Definitions. For the purposes of this Bylaw, the
following definitions shall apply:

                   (1) The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and
shall include, without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution,
defense, settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in,
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative.

                   (2) The term "expenses" shall be broadly construed and shall

judgment and any other costs and expenses of any nature or kind incurred in
connection with any proceeding.

                 (3) The term the "corporation" shall include, in addition to
the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any
constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if
its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under
the provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the resulting or surviving
corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its
separate existence had continued.

                 (4) References to a "director," "executive officer," "officer,"
"employee," or "agent" of the corporation shall include, without limitation,
situations where such person is serving at the request of the corporation as,
respectively, a director, executive officer, officer, employee, trustee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

                 (5) References to "other enterprises" shall include employee
benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on
a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at
the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or
involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to
an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest
of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be
deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation" as referred to in this Bylaw.

                                     NOTICES

     Section 44. Notices.

           (a)   Notice To Stockholders. Written notice to stockholders of
stockholder meetings shall be given as provided in Section 7 herein. Without
limiting the manner by which notice may otherwise be given effectively to
stockholders under any agreement or contract with such stockholder, and except
as otherwise required by law, written notice to stockholders for purposes other
than stockholder meetings may be sent by US mail or nationally recognized
overnight courier, or by facsimile, telegraph or telex or by electronic mail or
other electronic means.

           (b)   Notice to Directors. Any notice required to be given to any
director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a), or by overnight
delivery service, facsimile, telex

                                     xxiii.

or telegram, except that such notice other than one which is delivered
personally shall be sent to such address as such director shall have filed in
writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known
post office address of such director.

          (c) Affidavit of Mailing. An affidavit of mailing, executed by a duly
authorized and competent employee of the corporation or its transfer agent
appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, or other agent,
specifying the name and address or the names and addresses of the stockholder or
stockholders, or director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was
or were given, and the time and method of giving the same, shall in the absence
of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts therein contained.

          (d) Time Notices Deemed Given. All notices given by mail or by
overnight delivery service, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been
given as at the time of mailing, and all notices given by facsimile, telex or
telegram or by electronic mail or other electronic means shall be deemed to have
been given as of the sending time recorded at time of transmission. (e) Methods
of Notice. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be
employed in respect of all recipients of notice, but one permissible method may
be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or
methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.

          (f) Failure to Receive Notice. The period or limitation of time within
which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege
or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any
power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent in the
manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the
failure of such stockholder or such director to receive such notice.

          (g) Notice to Person with Whom Communication Is Unlawful. Whenever
notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom
communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be
required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or
agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or
meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom
communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice
had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is
such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall state, if such is the
fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to
receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.

          (h) Notice to Person with Undeliverable Address. Whenever notice is
required to be given, under any provision of law or the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any stockholder to whom (i)
notice of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings or of the
taking of action by written consent without a meeting to such person during the
period between such two consecutive annual meetings, or (ii) all, and at least
two, payments (if sent by first class mail) of dividends or interest on
securities during a twelve-

                                      xxiv.

month period, have been mailed addressed to such person at his address as shown
on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the
giving of such notice to such person shall not be required. Any action or
meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such person shall have
the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such
person shall deliver to the corporation a written notice setting forth his then
current address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be
reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to
require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to
persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to this paragraph.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                   AMENDMENTS

Bylaws, the Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the
affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the
voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock. The
Board of Directors shall also have the power to adopt, amend, or repeal Bylaws.

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                                LOANS TO OFFICERS

expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guarantee or other assistance may
be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as
the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of
shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to
deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at
common law or under any statute.

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                          CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
                                       OF
                               NVIDIA CORPORATION

                            (a Delaware corporation)

     NVIDIA Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), does hereby
certify:

     First:   The original name of the Corporation is NVIDIA Corporation.

     Second:  The date on which the Corporation's original Certificate of
Incorporation was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State is February 24,
1998 under the name of NVIDIA Delaware Corporation.

     Third:   The Board of Directors of the Corporation, acting in accordance
with Sections 141(f) and 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, adopted resolutions to amend Paragraph A of Article IV of the Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation to read in its
entirety as follows:

     "A. This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be
designated, respectively, "Common Stock" and "Preferred Stock." The total number
of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue is Five Hundred Two
Million (502,000,000) shares. Five Hundred Million (500,000,000) shares shall be
Common Stock, each having a par value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001). Two
Million (2,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, each having a par value of
one-tenth of one cent ($.001).

     The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series.
The Board of Directors is hereby authorized, by filing a certificate (a
"Preferred Stock Designation") pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law,
to fix or alter from time to time the designation, powers, preferences and
rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and to establish
from time to time the number of shares constituting any such series or any of
them; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent
to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of
such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall
be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting
such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the
resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series."

     Fourth:  Thereafter pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors this
Certificate of Amendment was submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation
for their approval, and was duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of
Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

<PAGE>

     Fifth:   All other provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation shall remain in full force and effect.

     In Witness Whereof, NVIDIA Corporation has caused this Certificate of
Amendment to be signed by its President and attested to by its Secretary in
Santa Clara, California this 31st day of August 2001.

                                        NVIDIA Corporation
